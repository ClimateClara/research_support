# Research Support

> Collaborative support for research

This repository aims at providing *tips, tricks, guides and examples* for various practical problems you might encounter when doing research, and *collaborative assistance* when a solution is not been already listed.
Hopefully it will help to share knowledge between lab members.

Guides and collections of tips and tricks are kept as files, sorted in folders by themes. (We may implement a way to obtain an index as well.)
Questions can be asked (and answered) by anyone by using the github issues.

For newcomers, we highlight [this guide](intro.md) which should cover the bases.
For those at LOCEAN, [that guide](PhD manual at LOCEAN/readme.md) contains more specific information and links to other internal documentations.

## Some guidelines

Please try to keep each issue on a single question/topic.
Before opening an issue, please look wether your question has already been asked.
If an issue already exists but has no answer, don't hesitate to 'bump' it by replying to it.

When a question has been resolved, please consider saving the proposed solution in the repository, in an existing file or a new one.
It can simply be copied as a gallery example, or put in a list of tips and tricks, or even turned into a guide.
In any case, please place a link to the issue.

If a solution already exists but an alternative comes up, please keep the old solution and specify it as an alternative or as obsolete if necessary.
