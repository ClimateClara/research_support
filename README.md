# Research Support

> Collaborative support for research

This repository aims at providing *tips, tricks, guides and examples* for various practical problems you might encounter when doing research, and *collaborative assistance* when a solution is not been already listed.
Hopefully it will help to share knowledge between lab members.

Guides and collections of tips and tricks are kept as files, sorted in folders by themes. (We may implement a way to obtain an index as well.)
Questions can be asked (and answered) by anyone by using the github issues.

For newcomers, we highlight the [guides here](intro) which should cover the bases, in particular the [welcome guide](intro/welcome guide.md) for our friends coming from outside France.
For those at LOCEAN, the [guides here](Administrative/readme.md) contain more specific information and links to other internal documentations.

## Contributing

To contribute, for now we are using forks and pull-requests. If you don't know what this means, this [section](intro/git.md#contributing-to-this-repository) of the [git guide](intro/git.md) covers exactly this.

Github can show a large variety of files, so you can contribute with python scripts, jupyter notebooks, bash scripts, and more.
The default format though is markdown, which is very easy to write and quite powerful. Check the [github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) about it, this will get you started in no time.

You can also store images (see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#images) for details), pdfs, etc.
Include links and a description of the original resources if possible.

## Some guidelines

Please try to keep each issue on a single question/topic.
Before opening an issue, please look wether your question has already been asked.
If an issue already exists but has no answer, don't hesitate to 'bump' it by replying to it.

When a question has been resolved, please consider saving the proposed solution in the repository, in an existing file or a new one.
It can simply be copied as a gallery example, or put in a list of tips and tricks, or even turned into a guide.
In any case, please place a link to the issue.

If a solution already exists but an alternative comes up, please keep the old solution and specify it as an alternative or as obsolete if necessary.
