# The defense / La soutenance

Some tips for your PhD defense.

## Book a room / lecture hall

**It is recommended to do this in advance!**
Some times of the year can be busy and finding a room can be tricky.

You can contact <isabelle.bauwe@sorbonne-universite.fr> it the UFR TEB. She manages the conference room of the UFR (46-00 2nd floor, for about 60 people?), but she can also help book a room elsewhere.

Another nice choice is the lecture hall Charpak (22-33 at level 0, for about 60+ people?). It is managed by the LPNHE lab; you can ask for a reservation here: https://lpnhe.in2p3.fr/limesurvey/index.php.

You can book other lecture halls in Jussieu (such as Astier or Durand in the Esclangon building, or any hall at the base of each tower). They generally have a good projection and sound system and can accommodate more people.
You can do the reservation by contacting <sciences-DLM-planning@sorbonne-universite.fr>.

Both the UFR room and Charpak hall should be equipped for video conferencing **but this is not the case for every room/lecture hall!** If not equipped, you must make an additional reservation for the equipment (microphones, camera), ask either Isabelle or sciences-DLM-planning.

In any case it is best to check if everything is working before the defense. Ask if there are availabilities the days before, and make the reservation so that you have time to setup and check things before the defense.
The Sorbonne website indicates that lecture halls are only available for 3 hours *but this is not the case*, tell them this is for a PhD defense and ask for a longer reservation.
Don't hesitate to ask for the phone of the 'appariteurs' (they will open the room and give you the equipment).

All the checking in the world won't protect you from random and weird technical problems though. It might be a good idea to have a backup plan for things that could break: internet (ethernet, eduroam, 4G ?), your slides (have you a pdf backup? have you videos or animations that could not work?), video conferencing (backup mic), or even your laptop!
**Be sure to have a safety-friend:** they can have a second laptop with your presentation in case of a problem, they can manage your video conference and cut off mics of noisy boomers (though note you may miss the most unexpected, unhinged comments from our senior citizens about your haircut or appearance ðŸ¤—).

Note that for any reservation you will need to give your name, surname, mail address, phone number, the nameÂ·s of your PhD supervisorÂ·s, the approximate number of people to accommodate, and whether you will need video conferencing.

## Invite jury members

It is probable that some members of your jury will not be from around here. You may have to deal with their trip to Paris.
First and foremost ask your supervisor about it, you have other things to worry about... but in case:
- If the member is affiliated to a french lab, they need an 'ordre de mission sans frais' from their lab (for legal insurance) that you will give to the admin team along with a 'demande d'ordre de mission' (for the LOCEAN here) so that you can pay them their trip and the hotel spa.
- same thing if they are affiliated to a lab abroad, but instead of a 'ordre de mission sans frais' they need a letter from their employer that certify the jury member is employed by them and authorized to go on this mission.

As for any work trip / mission, do this in advance and avoid (them) paying up front.

## The pot

This is surely the most awaited part of your defense!
But it is of course **not mandatory** by any means!

If the weather is good enough you can do it on the Jussieu ground floor / esplanade. The courtyard between 45 and 55 is protected from the rain if needed.
You can ask for tables at <sciences-DLM-planning@sorbonne-universite.fr>. Give them the day and hours, number of tables, and the location.

Otherwise the room 45-55 417 is open to reservations in the LOCEAN intranet, it can be a little small though.

You should find trash bags somewhere in conviviality areas, if not ask Moussa.
Some senior PhDs might already have some table cloth, ask around.

The IPSL has glasses, plates, cutlery, etc at 45-55 2nd floor. You can ask StÃ©phanie Boniface by mail to borrow them. You will have to wash them and place them back (the evening or morning after). There is a dishwasher though.

Champagne glasses ?

Financial help from the lab ?
