## Eduroam for Linux

To install Eduroam on your linux distribution, you'll need to know your "tutelle", in others words the institution providing your salary (usually for LOCEAN it is either
MNHN, CNRS, Sorbonne Universit√© or IRD, but it works with various institution such as Lille University for myself).
Then you have to get the email account and the associated password of your institution, you may find informations about this step on the other tutorials as it is not specific to Linux.
Afterwads, follow the instructions below : 
- Go on the [Eduroam installer](https://cat.eduroam.org/#), find your corresponding insitution and download the installer for your distribution (you should get .py script).
- Run the downloaded python script
``` shell
python ./eduroam-linux-UdL.py
```
and follow the given instructions (fill your instituion email accouant and your password).
- Get to your wifi parameters, select eduroam settings and fill it according to the picture

Apply the new settings and it should work !
