Warning : pdf "Guide missionaire avant mission et retour mission - CNRS", source needed for these docs, sent to me by J.Boutin, but should find the source before making the repository public. 

How to ask for a mission order (for a CNRS agent / mission using CNRS fees) :

- Enter the travel plan in Mon petit Carbone: https://carbone.locean-ipsl.upmc.fr/login.
  Download the form in pdf format to attach it to your mission order request.
- Request a mission order to Etamines: https://etamine-connecte.cnrs.fr
  Spending entity: 
  Origin: 
  Validator: 
  Attach the Mon petit carbon form
  Estimated transport costs via Goelett: https://travel.goelett.com/gtms/UserTrips

(If you are attached to Sorbonne and the administration also ask you for a SU (Sorbonne Unviersity) source of funding to do a SU mission order without fees, you also have to sign it and send it back to the administration before they can validate your mission request on Etamine.)

- This request must then be validated by management before plane tickets can be reserved.
- Reservations are made via the Notilus interface: https://esr-cnrs.notilus-inone.fr/#/Dashboard
  (Before starting the reservations from Notilus, don't forget to synchronise your profile on Notilus, after confirming the request on etamine.)
- Notilus will direct you back to Goelett, to reserve the tickets. Accept the pop-up (deactivate the pop-up blocker for this website on your PC).
- Reserve your travel tickets/hotel on Goelett, and wait for the "pending validation" message to appear.
- Then close the Goelett page and only after closing the Goelett page, confirm the repatriation of your reservations in Notilus.
- The mission should move to "OM validated" status (OM = Order mission)
- Adjust your fees if necessary
- You should get the confirmation emails for your tickets
- Download your mission order (it should be signed)

  Refer yourself to the attached pdf docs for the detailed procedure of mission request for a CNRS agent.
