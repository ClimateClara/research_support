# Fantastic Data and Where to Find Them

Some data can be confusing, there may be many different versions, treatment methods, etc.

Add your find and expertise, either in a section below, or its own document if there is much to say.

## Bathymethry

You can find bathymetry data at the [ETOPO](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/etopo-global-relief-model) project (NCEI/NOAA).
It's very high-resolution (highest is 15 arc-second, lowest available is 60 arc-second), available in NetCDF or GeoTiff. It covers ocean bathymetry and land topography.

Some older versions are present on spirit at `/bdd/etopo/`.

## High-res satellite photographs

This is mostly for fun, here are a couple of places where you can find some beautiful images.
But also some tools that can let you explore maybe more useful data.

- On https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov you will find a new image *every day* taken either from a satellite or astronauts in the ISS. It is also accompanied by an explanatory text. You can find the high-resolution versions of those images on https://visibleearth.nasa.gov. And since they have been doing this for decades now this is a huge collections of nice wallpapers üòÅ.

- The ESA is doing something similar with [Observing the Earth](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth). A bit more sparse but be sure to check Sentinel images, the zoom feature they have makes it all the more impressive.

- You can explore for yourself the images of the various Sentinel satellites at https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/browser (you might have to create an account).
  Maybe of most interest the true color from Sentinel-2, for some stunning images (its bands have resolutions between 10m and 60m!).
  
- And even more data from the NASA: https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/find-data. Maybe especially using the [Worldview](https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/).
